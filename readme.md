## Features

## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be generated by using the following Maven command:

```
mvn verify site -P h2,jetty,db-properties,development
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.

## Usage

The application is coded in Java, using Maven to manage the project.

### Prerequisites

The project has been tested on the following Java versions:
* JDK 8

All other dependencies are handled through Maven, and noted in the included POM file.

### Profiles

Maven profiles are included for setting up the database and an embedded server.

| Profile  | Database              |
|----------|-----------------------|
| h2       | H2 in-memory database |
| mysql    | MySQL database        |
| postgres | PostgreSQL database   |

| Profile  | Server                   |
|----------|--------------------------|
| jetty    | Jetty embedded server    |
| tomcat7  | Tomcat 7 embedded server |

| Profile     | Server                   |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| development | Development settings     |
| release     | Release settings         |

| Profile       | Server                                            |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| db-properties | DB authentication info taken from properties file |

### Installing

The project can be installed by creating the war file and deploying it into a server.

### Running

As this is a Spring Boot app it may be run with Maven or through your preferred IDE.

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

Once running it will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

### Running the tests

The project requires a database and a server for being able to run the integration tests.

Just like running the project, an embedded server with an in-memory database can be used:

```
mvn verify -P h2,jetty,db-properties,development
```

### Packaging the WAR

When creating the WAR file the database connection credentials should be read from the environment:

```
mvn package -P production,mysql -D database.auth.source=env
```

Check the documentation for more information.

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

### Issues management

Issues are managed at the GitHub [project issues tracker][issues], where any Github user may report bugs or ask for new features.

### Getting the code

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the [GitHub project page][scm], where the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.
